          Mission and vision statement of organization plays a pioneering role
          in attaining the overreaching objective, leaves no scope for ambiguity
          and confusion among stakeholders. I have conceptualized both vision &
          mission for the chabi initiative to streamline activities in a
          organized and formalized manner.
